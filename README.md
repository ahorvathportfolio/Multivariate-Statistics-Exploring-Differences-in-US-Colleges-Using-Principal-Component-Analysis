# Multivariate-Statistics-Exploring-Differences-in-US-Colleges-Using-Principal-Component-Analysis

This project was a group effort between myself and Ting-Jung Lee as our Final Project 
for STAT 5375 Multivariate Statistics taught by Dr. Ellingson in the Fall 2023 semester.

For this project, we intended to explore potential differences in the mean and covariance structure 
among the categorical variables (including locations, states, and the distinction between public and 
private universities) for East Coast Colleges. The goal was to explore if there are multiple distinct 
factors that lead to a personâ€™s decision to attend the college of their choice. This would be done via 
an Exploratory + Confirmatory Analysis which used Principal Component Analysis. All results can be found 
in the Report and I hope you all find it an interesting read!

Final Notes: 
- When arriving at Step 3 (Confirmatory Analysis) we will need the help of a 
  few functions which our instructor for the course, Dr. Ellingson, was kind enough to 
  provide us. These files include mardiatest.txt, EqualCovtest.txt, and TwoSampleT2test.txt.
  Make sure to turn them into MATLAB files and that they are in the same folder as the 
  Confirmatory Analysis Code in order to run without any issues.
